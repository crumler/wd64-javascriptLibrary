//RESTRICTIONS

/*

- a variable name must begin with a letter, underscore, or a dollar sign
- numbers may follow the above characters, BUT cannot come first
- JavaScript is case-sensitive
- no spaces are allowed within variable names
- camelCase is best practice for naming

*/

/*

KEYWORDS:

var, let, and const

    - var: 'old' keyword that stands for 'variable'.  ** we won't be using this as often, but it is still a viable keyword to use
    - let: 'new' keyword for 'variable'.  This was introduced with ES6 *newest version of ECMAScript, which is a standaization of JavaScript*
    - const: also a 'new' keyword that declares and UNCHANGABLE, or CONSTANT, variable.

*/

// var variable = 'var variable';
// let letVariable = 'let variable';

// let function = 1;  *Cannot use reserved words within a variable name - (such as 'function')

/*

DECLARATIONS & INITIALIZATIONS

*/

// let x; //this is a declaration (on the left side)

// let x = 10;  //the right side is the initialization

//10 is our initialization

// let y;

// console.log('declaration:', y);

// y = 10;
// console.log('initialization:', y);

//const

// let today = 'Great!';
// const efa = 'Wonderful!';

// console.log(today, efa);

// today = 'Awesome!';

// console.log(today, efa);

// efa = 'Superb!';

// console.log(today, efa);

//const allows us to make a variable that we don't want to change
